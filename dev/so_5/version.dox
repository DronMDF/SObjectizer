\page so_5__version so_5: Version History

\section so_5__2_0 5.2.0 "Tetnuld"

	A template not_null_event_data_t and all related stuff have been removed.

	A new base class for all signals (e.g. messages without any data)
	introduced. Since then all signals classes should be derived from
	so_5::rt::signal_t.

	Special checks for inheritance from so_5::rt::message_t and
	so_5::rt::signal_t inserted into deliver_message/deliver_signal and
	schedule_timer methods. Those checks work in compile-time.

	Special checks for not-null message pointers inserted into deliver_message
	and schedult_timer methods. So it is impossible to use those methods to send
	null messages. Signals should be used for this purpose.

\section so_5__1_2 5.1.2

	All comments in code have been translated to English.

	Some small code improvements and refactoring.

\section so_5__1_0 5.1.0 "Jimara"

	Transport layer has been rewritten.

	An exception handler/logger facility has been added.

	A cooperation listener has been added.

\section so_5__0_0 5.0.0 "Ushba"

	A first version of new generation of SObjectizer.
