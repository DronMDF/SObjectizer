\page so_5__version so_5: Version History

\section so_5__2_0 5.2.0 "Tetnuld"

	Format of so_5::rt::agent_coop_t::add_agent() methods has been changed.
	Now add_agent() accepts std::unique_ptr and raw so_5::rt::agent_t
	pointers, not agent_ref_t as in previous versions.

	An instance of so_5::rt::so_environment_params_t now is passed to
	so_5::rt::so_environment_t constructor by rvalue reference, not by
	const reference as in previous versions. 

	A template not_null_event_data_t and all related stuff have been removed.

	A new base class for all signals (e.g. messages without any data)
	introduced. Since then all signals classes should be derived from
	so_5::rt::signal_t.

	Special checks for inheritance from so_5::rt::message_t and
	so_5::rt::signal_t inserted into deliver_message/deliver_signal and
	schedule_timer methods. Those checks work in compile-time.

	Special checks for not-null message pointers inserted into deliver_message
	and schedult_timer methods. So it is impossible to use those methods to send
	null messages. Signals should be used for this purpose.

	Some changes to message dispatching scheme.

	Some refactoring of code inside SObjectizer internals.
